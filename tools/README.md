This directory contains a number of useful scripts and tools that can be used across
several containers of the easy-build project:
* `bblog-analyze.sh`: Analyze a timestamped BitBake build log
* `do_mirror.sh`: Mirror a list of remote directories
* `prepend-timestamp.sh`: Prepend date/time for each line in stdin (i.e. the BitBake log)
* `run-bblog-analysis.sh`: Invoke `bblog-analyze.sh` for each file in LOGFILES

Please read comments inside each script for more details about how to use and customize  them.
